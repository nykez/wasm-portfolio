    "About": "Hello, my name is Nykez (Jordan). I started programing in 2009 when I discovered Garry's Mod (a game by facepunch). This sparked a unknown passion for me! I continued to 'mod' games off and on for many years until deciding to pursue Computer Science in college. Years later, I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and continued my passion into a full time career - Software Engineering.",
